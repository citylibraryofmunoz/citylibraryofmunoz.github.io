	   <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
  <p>
    A library is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing. It provides physical or digital access to material and may be a physical building or room, or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items. Sidney Sheldon perfectly describes: “Libraries store the energy that fuels the imagination. They open up windows to the world and inspire us to explore and achieve, and contribute to improving our quality of life.”
 </p>	   
 <p>
   Laura Bush in her famous quote said: “I have found the most valuable thing in my wallet is my library card.” Visit your library, get your library card, and you’ll be able to borrow a print or electronic book, use free internet, or attend a course that will improve your digital skills.
</p>       
<p>
  The libraries of the world are under threat. Jon Bing makes a point “To ask why we need libraries at all, when there is so much information available elsewhere, is about as sensible as asking if roadmaps are necessary now that there are so very many roads.” Eleanor Crumblehulme says “Cutting libraries during a recession is like cutting hospitals during a plague.”
</p>       
<p>
  Libraries are essential in a process of giving citizens access to knowledge. In digital times they are needed more than ever before. In times of the internet, everyone can visit a library without leaving home. It’s just a matter of opening a library website, and you can not only borrow an ebook but also ask the librarian an online question. Most importantly, however, libraries are the places where you can expect smart and clear answers to even the most difficult questions.
</p>
        
<p>
  Now that we have discussed the importance of libraries, it’s time to through some light on the importance of the role of librarians. Jarrett J. Krosoczka says “It is an awfully sad misconception that librarians simply check books in and out ...” A librarian is a person who is in charge of or works professionally in a library and is responsible for its management and services. The librarian takes care of the library and its resources. Typical job of a librarian includes managing collection development and acquisitions, cataloging, collections management, circulation, and providing a range of services, such as reference, information, instruction, and training services, etc.
</p>      
<p>
  The increasing role of technology in libraries has a significant impact on the changing roles of librarians. A 21st-century librarian is required to be very much updated with technological changes. New age librarians are making greater use of emerging technologies in the library management and services to make it more popular and useful among the patrons. According to Neil Gaiman “Google can bring you back 100,000 answers, a librarian can bring you back the right one.” New age librarians are not mere bookworms, they are high-tech information professionals, and clever communicators, helping patrons dive in the oceans of information available in books and digital records. Librarians are teachers, problem solvers, innovators, collaborators, leaders, and learners.
